### Problem Statement:
The objective of this project is to build a classification model to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. We will use the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which contains various features of the passengers, including personal details, socio-economic status, and travel details. The goal is to create a robust model that can accurately classify whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on these features.

### Problem Description:
The Titanic dataset includes information about the passengers on the Titanic, such as their age, gender, ticket class, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, fare, and port of embarkation. The dataset also includes a binary outcome variable indicating whether each passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0) the disaster.

Using the Random Forest algorithm, we aim to:

Preprocess and clean the dataset to handle missing values and encode categorical variables.

Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the relationships between features and the target variable.

Split the data into training and testing sets to build and evaluate the model.

Scale the features to ensure they are on the same scale, which helps improve model performance.

Train the Random Forest classifier to predict the survival of passengers.

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Provide a mechanism for user input to make real-time survival predictions for new passenger data.

This project will demonstrate the application of Random Forest in a real-world classification problem and showcase best practices in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
